# Iconography

The GDPR's [Article 12, subsection 7](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-12-gdpr/) strongly promotes a set of standardised icons to facilitate the understanding of processing by citizens. When done so electronically, the law stresses that these icons must be machine readable. 

Given the Open Data Rights API's involvement in user experience, it could be desirable to create a set of reusable, standardised icons in connection of data processing. This set of icons should cover at least:

* All data rights
* All grounds for processing
* A large majority of data types

This process could be undertaken along with another open source community, or perhaps be based on an existing, comprehensive icon set. Regardless, the user experience, accessibility and usability of these icons must be significant.
