# Data Rights Registry

Citizens may not always know which organisations are processing their data. In this case, it could be desirable to have an authority that keeps track of which organisations process what data, and where their API is available. Regardless on whether this needs to become a registry, there will be a need for standardising the discovery of Open Data Rights APIs.

Multiple models for facilitating this idea can be though of, both centralised and decentralised. However, we encourage the Open Data Rights community to strongly consider the user experience of data rights when operationalising these ideas.
