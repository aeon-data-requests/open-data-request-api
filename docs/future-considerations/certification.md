# Certification

As the Open Data Rights API find more widespread adoption, ensuring quality of implementation should be a high priority. In order to get more involved in this process, a certification process could be drawn up.

Given that proper governance and regulation has taken place, a certification process could be drawn up for organisations participating in the API. This certification process should include strict and continuous review of API implementations, and the process as a whole. If organisations comply with these standards, they should receive certification. This certification might be operationalized in the form of a check-mark which carries the weight of the Open Data Rights community.

Through such cooperation with organisations, the Open Data Rights API can more closely coordinate and improve the status quo of data requests.
