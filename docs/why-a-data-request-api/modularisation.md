# Modularisation

If an API is standardised and accessible for third parties, the front-end and back-end of any data rights experience is no longer tightly coupled.

### A strict back-end



### A modular front-end

The user-facing aspects of a data rights experience have the strongest cards to delight or depress a citizen. Inventing this wheel again and again not only leads to fragmentation, but frustration on part of the end-user. 

Moreover this competition means reduced compliance costs for organisations. While they may offer a front-end for exercising data rights, these front-ends are interchangeable and commodified. Organisations no longer need to lock in to a particular compliance vendor, if the product is missing their needs. If the front-end is based on open-source tools, the organisation can choose fork and adjust it to its needs.

Finally, organisations may even make the case that if third party software is available to connect to the API, they should be exempt from offering anything but a data request API.
