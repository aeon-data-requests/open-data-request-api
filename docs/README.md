# Introduction

This interactive whitepaper aims to establish a standardised method of requesting data from data processors in the European Union. The whitepaper is substantiated by an API proposal definition, following the OpenAPI 3 specification. The documentation for this API proposal is available [here](https://bump.sh/doc/open-dsar-api). Additionally, the whitepaper describes a background, and rationale for a data request API, a substantive proposal and considerations for future use.
